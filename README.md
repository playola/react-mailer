# react-mailer

Trying out SendGrid using templates generated with React and compatible for IE.

## Getting started

```
  git clone https://github.com/playola/react-mailer.git

  cd react-mailer

  npm install
```

After install the dependencies, you must modify the variables `to` and `from` with a real email. You will find it in index.js > line 19-20.

Then, it will generate and send an email with the selected receiver and sender.
